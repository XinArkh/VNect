Architecture and tips of `annot.mat` in every `SX/SeqX` dir
####################


1.
In `annot.mat` contains: 
    annot2 (14x1 cell)
    annot3 (14x1 cell)
    univ_annot3 (14x1 cell)
    cameras (1x14 double)
    frames (SOME_NUMx1 double)

2.
In annot2: one cell corresponds to one camera perspective. Every cell contains SOME_NUMx56 double.
In one cell: every row corresponds to one annotion of frame, the count of rows is also the count of annotated frames.
56 columns correspond to 28 joint positions in 2D. Coordinate order: x1, y1, x2, y2 ..., x28, y28.

3.
In annot3: one cell corresponds to one camera perspective. Every cell contains SOME_NUMx84 double.
In one cell: every row corresponds to one annotion of frame, the count of rows is also the count of annotated frames.
84 columns correspond to 28 joint positions in 3D. Coordinate order: x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2 ..., x28, y28, z28.

4.
In univ_annot3: architecture same with annot3.
The difference from annot3: the coordinate system of univ_annot3 is normalized(how?).

5.
In cameras: camera indexes, from 0 to 13.

6.
In frames: frame indexes, from 0 to SOME_NUM-1. The count of rows is the count of frames.

7.
In some cases, some sequences have a few frames missing at the end but annotations still available.
Thus it is advisable to get the frame count F from `util/mpii_get_sequence_info.m` read only the first F rows of annotations. 

8.
The joint order corresponding to the coordinate order can be seen in `all_joint_names` in `util/mpii_get_joint_set.m`

9.
In the coordinate system:
    x-direction: right(-->)
    y-direction: down(V)
    z-direction: forwarding(obeying right-hand rule given x and y)
